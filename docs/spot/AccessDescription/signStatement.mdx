Since XT needs to provide some open interfaces for third-party platforms, the issue of **data security** needs to be considered.

Such as:

- Whether the data has been tampered with
- Whether the data is outdated
- Whether the data can be submitted repeatedly
- The access frequency of the interface

Among these, **whether data has been tampered with is the most important issue**.

### Steps

1. **Appkey & Secretkey** Apply for `appkey` and `secretkey` in the user center first, each user's keys are different.

2. **Timestamp** Add `timestamp`.

   - Its value should be the **unix timestamp (milliseconds)** of the time when the request is sent.
   - The time of the data is calculated based on this value.

3. **Signature** Add `signature`, its value is obtained by the signature algorithm rule.

4. **RecvWindow** Add `recvwindow` (defines the valid time of the request).

   - Valid time is fixed at a certain value.
   - When a request is received, the server checks if:

     ```
     serverTime - timestamp < recvwindow
     ```

   - Any request older than **5000 ms** is invalid.
   - If the client’s timestamp is more than **1 second ahead of server time**, the request is invalid.

   **Note:** Online conditions are not always 100% reliable. That’s why we provide the `recvWindow` parameter:

   - For high-frequency trading, adjust `recvWindow` to meet timeliness needs.
   - RecvWindow longer than **5 seconds** is **not recommended**.

5. **Algorithm** Add `algorithms` (signature method).
   - Recommended: `HmacSHA256`
   - Supported algorithms:
     - HmacMD5
     - HmacSHA1
     - HmacSHA224
     - **HmacSHA256 (recommended)**
     - HmacSHA384
     - HmacSHA512
