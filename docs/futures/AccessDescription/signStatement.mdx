Since XT provides open interfaces for third-party platforms, **data security** must be ensured â€” such as preventing data tampering, avoiding outdated data, stopping repeated submissions, and controlling request frequency. Among these, verifying whether the data has been tampered with is the most critical.

### Signature Rules

1. **AppKey & SecretKey** Distributed offline. Different calls should use different `appkey` and `secretkey`.

2. **Timestamp** Add a timestamp in **milliseconds (Unix timestamp)** of the request time. The validity of the request is calculated based on this value.

3. **Signature** All request data must be signed.

4. **RecvWindow** The validity period is set by `recvWindow`. Default is **5 seconds**, maximum **60 seconds**.

   - If the timestamp is more than **5000ms older** than server time, the request is invalid.
   - If the client timestamp is more than **1 second ahead** of the server, the request is also rejected.
   - RecvWindow **> 5 seconds is not recommended**. This mechanism handles **network jitter** and helps ensure timeliness in high-frequency trading.

5. **Signature Algorithms** Signatures are calculated with HSC-based protocols. Default: **HmacSHA256** Supported: `HmacMD5`, `HmacSHA1`, `HmacSHA224`, `HmacSHA256`, `HmacSHA384`, `HmacSHA512`
