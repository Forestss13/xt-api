Some interfaces will have limited flow control (the corresponding interface will have a limited flow description).
The flow limit is mainly divided into **gateway flow limit** and **WAF flow limit**.

If the interface request triggers the gateway flow limit, **429** will be returned,
indicating that the access frequency exceeds the limit, and the **IP** or **apiKey** will be blocked.

Gateway flow limiting is divided into:

- **IP flow limiting**
- **apiKey flow limiting**

**Example descriptions**:

- IP flow limit: `100/s/ip` → indicates the limit of the number of requests **per second per IP** for this interface.

- apiKey flow limit: `50/s/apiKey` → indicates the limit of the number of requests **per second per apiKey** for this interface.
