1. **AUTH_105**  
   The server verifies the request header parameters `validate-timestamp` (`validTimeStamp`) and `validate-recvwindow` (`recvwindow`).

   The following rules must be followed:

dealTimeStamp (server time when the request is processed, in milliseconds)

validTimeStamp < recvwindow

Otherwise **AUTH_105** will be returned.

To avoid this error:

- `validate-timestamp` is recommended to use the time when the request was sent, in **milliseconds**.
- `validate-recvwindow` should be set a little larger.
