### Description
Each client connection must periodically send a text **"ping"**, and the server will reply with the text **"pong"**. If the server does not receive a ping message from the client within 1 minute, it will actively disconnect the connection.

---

### Example

#### Python
```python
from websocket import create_connection

ws = create_connection("wss://stream.xt.com/notice")

# Periodically send ping
ws.send("ping")
print(ws.recv())  # Expected response "pong"
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "msg": "pong"
}
```
