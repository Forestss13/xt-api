Subscription Steps

Step 1: The user needs to call the interface: /v1/user/listen-key to get the listenKey.

Step 2: When subscribing to user-related WebSocket events, users need to send:
{
  "method": "SUBSCRIBE",
  "params": ["order@{listenKey obtained in the previous step}"],
  "id": "test1"
}


If you receive "invalid_listen_key", it means that the listenKey is expired or invalid, and you need to re-request to obtain the listenKey.

Note: The listenKey is obtained through the interface.

User-related data will be pushed after subscription.
