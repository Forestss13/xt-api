### Heartbeat

Each link of the client needs to send a text "ping" periodically, and the server will reply to the text "pong". If the server does not receive a ping message from the client within 30 seconds, it will actively disconnect the link.

### Python Example

```python
# Python code to send "ping" to the server
import websocket

ws = websocket.create_connection("wss://example.com/ws")
ws.send("ping")

Response Example
{
  "id": "123",
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "pong"
}
```
