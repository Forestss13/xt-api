Since XT needs to provide some open interfaces for third-party platforms, the issue of **data security** must be considered. For example:

- Whether the data has been tampered with
- Whether the data is outdated
- Whether the data can be submitted repeatedly
- Whether the interface access frequency is exceeded

Among these, **whether the data has been tampered with is the most important**.

### Rules

1. **AppKey & SecretKey** Please apply for `appkey` and `secretkey` in the user center first. Each user's `appkey` and `secretkey` are different.

2. **Timestamp** Its value should be the Unix timestamp (milliseconds) when the request is sent. The data validity is calculated based on this value.

3. **Signature** Add `signature`, its value is obtained by a certain rule of the signature algorithm.

4. **RecvWindow** Defines the valid time of the request.

   - The server checks whether the timestamp falls between **2s and 60s**.
   - Requests older than **5000ms** are invalid.
   - If the client timestamp is **>1s ahead** of the server time, the request is invalid.
   - Longer than **5s is not recommended**.
   - You can adjust `recvWindow` for high-frequency trading.

5. **Algorithms** The signature is calculated using a **hash protocol**. Recommended: **HmacSHA256**. Supported: `HmacMD5`, `HmacSHA1`, `HmacSHA224`, `HmacSHA256`, `HmacSHA384`, `HmacSHA512`.
