### AUTH_105

The server verifies the request header parameters:

- `validate-timestamp` (validTimeStamp)
- `validate-recvwindow` (recvwindow)

The following rules must be followed:

```
dealTimeStamp (server time when the request is processed, in milliseconds) - validTimeStamp < recvwindow
```

Otherwise, **AUTH_105** will be returned.

#### How to avoid this error?

- `validate-timestamp` is recommended to use the time when the request is sent, measured in **milliseconds**.
- `validate-recvwindow` should be set slightly larger to allow for network jitter.
