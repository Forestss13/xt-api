Due to the reasons of high latency and poor stability, it is **not recommended** to access the XT API through a proxy.

- **GET** request parameters are put in **query Params**.
- **POST** request parameters are put in **request body**.

The request header information must be set to:

Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded

In addition to the parameters required by the interface itself, a **signature** parameter needs to be passed in the query Params or request body. Interfaces that do not require the signature parameter will be explicitly noted.
