Since XT provides some open interfaces for third-party platforms, **data security** must be considered. For example: preventing data tampering, avoiding outdated data, avoiding repeated submissions, and controlling access frequency. Among them, **data tampering** is the most critical issue.

### Steps

1. **Apply for appkey and secretkey**

   - Apply in the user center first.
   - Each user’s `appkey` and `secretkey` are different.

2. **Add timestamp**

   - Value should be the **Unix timestamp in milliseconds** when the request is sent.
   - Server verifies data freshness based on this value.

3. **Add signature**

   - Generated according to the signature algorithm rules.
   - This ensures request integrity.

4. **Add recvwindow** (valid time window)

   - Defines request validity time.
   - When a request is received, server checks timestamp:
     - Must fall between **2–60 seconds**.
     - Requests older than **5000 ms** are invalid.
     - Requests ahead of server time > 1 second are also invalid.
   - Default recommended: **≤ 5 seconds**.
   - You can adjust `recvWindow` for high-frequency trading to better match latency.

5. **Add algorithm (signature method/algorithm)**
   - User calculates the signature with hashing protocol.
   - Recommended: **HmacSHA256**.
   - Supported: `HmacMD5`, `HmacSHA1`, `HmacSHA224`, `HmacSHA256`, `HmacSHA384`, `HmacSHA512`.
