### Notes

Due to reasons such as high latency and poor stability, it is not recommended to access the API through a proxy.

- GET request parameters should be placed in **query params**.
- POST request parameters should be placed in the **request body**.
- Please set the request header information to:Content-Type=application/json

For requests that start other than /public, the request message needs to be signed
