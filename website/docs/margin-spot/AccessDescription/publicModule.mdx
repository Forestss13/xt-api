### Overview

Some interfaces will have limited flow control (the corresponding interface will have a limited flow description). The flow limit is mainly divided into **gateway flow limit** and **WAF flow limit**.

If the interface request triggers the gateway flow limit, **429** will be returned, indicating that the access frequency exceeds the limit, and the **IP or apiKey will be blocked**.

---

### Gateway Flow Limiting Types

- **IP Flow Limiting** Example: `100/s/ip` → The limit is 100 requests per second for each IP.

- **apiKey Flow Limiting** Example: `50/s/apiKey` → The limit is 50 requests per second for each API Key.

### Notes

- If you exceed these limits, requests will be rejected and further access may be temporarily blocked.
- It is recommended to implement **retry logic with backoff** in your client to avoid continuous 429 errors.
