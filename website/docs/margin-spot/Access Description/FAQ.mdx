1. AUTH_105: The server verifies the request header parameters validate-timestamp (validTimeStamp) and validate-recvwindow (recvwindow).

The following rules must be followed: dealTimeStamp (server time when the request is processed, in milliseconds) - validTimeStamp < recvwindow, otherwise AUTH_105 will be returned.

To avoid this error, validate-timestamp recommends using the time when the request was sent, and it is measured in milliseconds. The validate-recvwindow is set a little larger.
