Since XT needs to provide some open interfaces for third-party platforms, it requires data security issues of the interface, such as whether the data has been tampered with, whether the data is outdated, whether the data can be submitted repeatedly, and the frequency of access to the interface within a certain period of time. Among them, **whether the data has been tampered with is the most important**.

1. **Offline distribution** of `appkey` and `secretkey`, for different calls, provide different `appkey` and `secretkey`.
2. **Timestamp**: the value should be the Unix timestamp (milliseconds) of the time when the request is sent, and the valid time of the data is calculated according to this value.
3. **Signature**: add signature information for all data.
4. **RecvWindow**: defines the valid time window.
   - Default: 5 seconds.
   - Maximum: 60 seconds.
   - Requests older than 5000ms are invalid.
   - If the client’s timestamp is more than 1 second ahead of server time, the request is rejected.
   - For high-frequency trading scenarios, you can set `recvWindow` flexibly. **Not recommended to exceed 5 seconds.**
5. **Algorithms**: supported signature algorithms are: HmacMD5, HmacSHA1, HmacSHA224, HmacSHA256 (default), HmacSHA384, HmacSHA512
