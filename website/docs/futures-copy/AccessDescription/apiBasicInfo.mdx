Due to the reasons of high latency and poor stability, it is **not recommended** to access the XT API through a proxy.

- **GET** request parameters are placed in **query Params**.
- **POST** request parameters are placed in the **request body**.

The request header should be set as:

Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded

In addition to the parameters required by the interface itself, the **signature** parameter must also be passed in the query Params or request body.

> Interfaces that do **not** require the signature parameter will be explicitly explained in their documentation.
