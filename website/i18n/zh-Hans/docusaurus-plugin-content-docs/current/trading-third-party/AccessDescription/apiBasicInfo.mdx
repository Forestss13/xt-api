### Notes

- Due to reasons such as high latency and poor stability, it is **not recommended** to access the API through a proxy.
- **GET** request parameters are placed in **query params**, **POST** request parameters are placed in the **request body**.
- Please set the request header information to: `Content-Type=application/json`.
- For requests that do not start with `/public`, the request message needs to be **signed**.
