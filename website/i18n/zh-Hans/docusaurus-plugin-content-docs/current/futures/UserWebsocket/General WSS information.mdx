### 基础地址

**wss://fstream.xt.com/ws/user**

---

### 请求 Headers

The request header of the compression extension protocol must be added:

```http
Sec-Websocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate
```

---

### Subscription Steps

**Step 1:** Call the interface `/v1/user/listen-key` to obtain the **listenKey**.

**Step 2:** When subscribing to user-related WebSocket events, send:

```json
{
  "方法": "SUBSCRIBE",
  "params": ["order@{listenKey obtained in the previous step}"],
  "id": "test1"
}
```

---

### 注意事项

- If you receive **`invalid_listen_key`**, it means the listenKey is expired or invalid. 👉 Re-request a new listenKey through the interface.
- 用户-related data will be pushed **after subscription is successful**.
